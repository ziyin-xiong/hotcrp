HotCRP Conference Review Software
=================================

HotCRP is awesome software for managing conference review processes. It supports paper submission, review and comment
management, rebuttals, and the PC meeting. It has been widely used in computer science conferences and for
internal review processes at several large companies.

Multitrack conferences with per-track deadlines should use other software.

HotCRP is the open-source version of the software running on
[hotcrp.com](https://hotcrp.com). If you want to run HotCRP without setting
up your own server, use hotcrp.com. See its original [repo](https://github.com/kohler/hotcrp) for more detailed README.
